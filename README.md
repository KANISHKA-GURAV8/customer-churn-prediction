# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained on telecom customer data and deployed using a Flask web application.

## Features
- Supervised ML classification model
- Handles class imbalance using SMOTE
- Predicts churn and churn probability
- Web interface using Flask and HTML

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask app:
python app.py

4. Open browser and go to:
